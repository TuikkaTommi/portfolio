# Express.js CRUD-backend for managing disc golf scores in database

This is an authenticated CRUD-backend for managing players' scores inside a MongoDB database. It was made for the backend-development course. This server follows a basic architecture where controllers, models and routes have their own respective folders, and those folders have separate files for user and score-functionalities.

[Controllers](https://github.com/TuikkaTommi/portfolio/tree/main/Express/playerscorebackend/controllers) contain the methods that interact with the database. Connection to the db is established inside [dbconnection.js](https://github.com/TuikkaTommi/portfolio/blob/main/Express/playerscorebackend/dbconnection.js). This file fetches the db:s information from .env, so the details are hidden from the code. The [models](https://github.com/TuikkaTommi/portfolio/tree/main/Express/playerscorebackend/models)-folder contains the model-files for players, score-objects and users. [Routes](https://github.com/TuikkaTommi/portfolio/tree/main/Express/playerscorebackend/routes)-folder has files for creating the endpoints where different methods are available for the user of this server. [App.js](https://github.com/TuikkaTommi/portfolio/blob/main/Express/playerscorebackend/app.js)-file creates the actual server, by implementing the routers and middlewares inside it.

The authentication for secured routes is done with jwt-tokens.
