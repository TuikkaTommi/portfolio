## Projects üîß

### [FribaScore frontend for disc golf, made with Svelte](https://github.com/TuikkaTommi/portfolio/tree/main/Svelte/fribascore)

This was a project for the Frontend basics course. The main focus was on learning Svelte-framework and its component-structures and basic usage of stores. The app allows the user to save, view and delete their disc golf rounds.

### [FribaScore frontend app, but implemented with Angular](https://github.com/TuikkaTommi/portfolio/tree/main/Angular/fribascore)

This is an Angular-version of the disc golf app. The basic features are the same as in the Svelte version.

Backend created for manipulating a MongoDB database that stores disc golf scores. User can add, view and update scores.
