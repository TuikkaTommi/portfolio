This is a (slightly WIP) portfolio-repository for my career as a software developer. A list of my projects can be found [here](#projects-).

I'm currently studying web-development at [JAMK University of Applied Sciences](https://www.jamk.fi/en), and I'm looking for internship- and job-opportunities to launch my professional career.

## About me ⛷️

I'm on the final stretch of my studies, and I have gathered a wide set of skills on web-development during that time. I've specialized myself in fullstack-development, mainly on JavaScript and its relating technologies. As a developer, I am an independent worker, and have great self-management skills, but I also work well within a team. I love solving problems and challenging myself with new things. I also really like learning new skills, and do so constantly. I have a strong drive to produce high quality, maintainable code, for example with reusability and clarity of code, and efficient documentation. I also pay attention to clarity and efficiency within general communication in a dev-team, as I believe it is a key component for successful teamwork.
