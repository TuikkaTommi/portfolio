This is a (slightly WIP) portfolio-repository for my web-development career. Different technologies have their own directories with the projects inside them and a list of these projects can be found [here](#projects-).

I'm currently studying web-development at [JAMK University of Applied Sciences](https://www.jamk.fi/en), and I'm looking for internship- and job-opportunities that can help me develop myself as a professional.

## About me ‚õ∑Ô∏è

I'm on the final stretch of my studies, and I have gathered a wide set of skills on web-development during that time. I've specialized myself in fullstack-development, mainly on JavaScript and its relating technologies. I am an independent worker, and I have great self-management skills, but I also work well within a team. I love solving problems and challenging myself with new things. I also really like learning new skills, and do so constantly. During development, I put effort into keeping the code as clear and readable as possible, so that we as a group can work efficiently. I also follow this rule with general communication within the team, as it is a key component in a successful software project. I also want to help others with the problems they are facing, whenever I‚Äôm able to.
